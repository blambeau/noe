# Noe template for ruby projects

This is my Noe template for ruby projects. Once generated you'll have a fresh new ruby project
that works, supports unit and spec tests and so on!

## Install

* copy the whole folder in ~/.noe

## Instantiation

    noe create --ruby foo
    cd foo
    edit foo.noespec
    noe go
    
## Usage

    # Run spec tests
    rake spec
    
    # Generate gem
    rake gem
