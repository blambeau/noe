#
# This file provides a full specification for maintaining your ruby library using Noe.
# It consists of two main sections: template-info and variables. The first one contains
# meta-information about the skeleton itself while the second one provides information
# about your library.
# 
# Please update the first part with care, as it immediately affects the way Noe will 
# manage the files of your own project. The second part may be updated more freely.
#
# Remember that your project may use a shorter version of this file as it will be 
# automatically completed with default options when invoking 'noe go'. In particular, 
# the first section (under template-info) is only required to contain the name and 
# version of the template to use. 
#
# Use 'noe prepare --template=!{template_name} --layout=short' to generate a shorter
# version of this file.
#
# See 'noe help prepare' and 'noe help show-spec' for more information.
#
template-info:

  # Don't remove the name and version entries, which are ALWAYS required 
  name: "!{template_name}"
  version: 1.1.0

  # The following entries are information about the template itself and can safely 
  # be removed on your own project.

    Template for creating a ruby gem following best ruby practices
  description: |
    This is a [Noe](https://github.com/blambeau/noe) template for creating a ruby gem 
    library. Generated project comes with rake tasks to support the lifecycle of the 
    library (testing, releasing, and so on). Following Noe's philosophy this template 
    also helps you understanding the ruby ecosystem by providing a fully documented 
    project, rake tasks, and so on.

  # By default, this is the wlang dialect used to instantiate the template files. You can 
  # safely remove it from your own project.
  main-wlang-dialect: wlang/ruby
    
  #
  # Below starts the template manifest. 
  #
  # Each entry is related to a template file and may contain the following keys:
  #   - description: short explanation of the role the file plays in your project
  #   - safe-override: may the file be safely overrided by 'noe go --safe-override'?
  #   - wlang-dialect: what dialect must be used for wlang instantiation. When no 
  #     dialect is specified, the dialect under main-wlang-dialect is used.
  #
  # You can safely remove the whole manifest or entries for which the default values
  # are ok for your project. Otherwise, values defined below override the default ones
  # provided by the template. 
  #
  # An typical example for keeping an entry here is to set safe-override to false for 
  # specific project files you want to manage manually.

# The following entries are template-related variables. Update to match your 
# own configuration.
variables:
  # A ruby lower case project name. This will become the name of the generated
  # gem of the main ruby .rb start file and so on.
  lower: 
    hello_world

  # A ruby upper case project name. This is used to generate the main namespacing
  # module of your project and shoul be the CamelCase equivalent of your lower 
  # name.
  upper:
    HelloWorld

  # Project summary. The summary should be a short project description (5 lines)
  # and will be used to annotate your .gemspec file on rubygems.org.
  summary: A simple "Hello World" example for Noe's skeleton for Ruby projects
    
  # Authors of the project. Each author entry is a Hash and MUST at least have 
  # 'name' and 'email' keys. This is used to add meta information to your .gemspec 
  # file. Example:
  #
  # authors: 
  #  - name:  Bob
  #    email: bob@gmail.com
  #
  authors: []

  # Web links for the project. You should typically include links to the sources
  # (github), rubygems.org, documentation and so on. The first link will be used
  # to fill the .gemspec file. Example:
  #
  # links:
  #   - http://github.com/bob/hello_world
  #   - http://rubygems.org/gems/hello_world
  #
  links: []

  # Gem dependencies. Each entry is a Hash that MUST at least have 'name', 'version'
  # and 'groups' keys. The later is an array of dependency groups and are used to 
  # generate Gemfile and .gemspec files. For now, only 'development' and 'runtime'
  # values are supported.
  #
  # Example
  #   # Rake is required for development only
  #   - {name: rake, version: "~> 0.8.7", groups: [development]}
  #   # HighLine is required at runtime
  #   - {name: highline, version: ">= 0", groups: [runtime]}
  #   # WLang is required for both development and runtime
  #   - {name: wlang, version: ">= 0", groups: [runtime, development]}
  #
  dependencies: 
    # Rake is required for developers, as usual
    - {name: rake,      version: "~> 0.8.7", groups: [development]}
    # Bundler is required for developers and is used by the Rakefile
    - {name: bundler,   version: "~> 1.0",   groups: [development]}
    # RSpec is required to run 'rake spec'. See tasks/spec.rake 
    - {name: rspec,     version: "~> 2.4.0", groups: [development]}
    # YARD and BlueCloth are required to run 'rake yard'. See tasks/yard.rake 
    - {name: yard,      version: "~> 0.6.4", groups: [development]}
    - {name: bluecloth, version: "~> 2.0.9", groups: [development]}
